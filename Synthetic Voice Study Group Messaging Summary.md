Synthetic voice is a powerful tool and as such, must be protected against
misuse and exploitation of the technology.

## 30 Second Elevator Speech
Synthetic voice is a machine generated replica of a natural human voice. When used properly, synthetic
voice can increase access and inclusion, add layers of protectivity to sensitive documents and
information, and improve customer service. When used improperly, synthetic voice can cause data
breaches, and identity and intellectual property theft.

## Executive Summary
As many would associate synthetic voice in a negative light, the OVON is working hard to educate the
public and other stakeholders that it is more than just deep fakes and misleading information. Synthetic
voice has incredible potential to serve in a positive and beneficial way. Knowing the difference between
those good and bad implications is crucial as society moves forward with this fast-moving technology.

## Industry Size / Background Data
* According to the Edison Research Report Infinite Dial 20211, in February, 193 million people in the US
consumed online audio. In fact, according to Beyond Words (aka SpeechKit), when new users engage
with AI audio content on a website, their average time spent is 5 minutes and 53 seconds as opposed to
the 30 second norm. Those users also visit 19% more pages per session.
* The number of engaged listeners in spoken word audio is on the rise. As of 2021, 22 million more people
are listening to it than 7 years prior.3 127 million people daily consume audio content as opposed to 105
in 2014. And according to Edison Research Share of Ear, time spent is also increasing: a 71% increase in
the last seven years by females and 23% in males.
* The important takeaway is that more people are adopting and utilizing voice in their media and
information consumption. And that use is accounting for more and more of their time spent.

## What Is a Synthetic Voice?
A synthetic voice is a machine generated replica of a natural human voice. The most popular form of
creating a synthetic voice (speech synthesis) is when the human voice “teaches” the machine through
spoken data and corresponding transcripts how to learn and predict its words and intonations. Once
trained, the technology can transform novel text into speech with the pronunciation and intonation of
the natural human voice associated. This allows for the human voice to not have to repeat words
repeatedly as the machine has learned and banked multiple iterations.

## What Is the Market Value for Synthetic Voice?
* As of 2020, the valuation of the Global Voice Recognition Market projected to be $10.7 billion (USD).
This sum is expected to grow to $27.16 billion by 2026.6 The primary use case of voice tech is voice
assistance and in 2020, there were 4.2 billion voice assistants being used around the world. That number
is expected to balloon to 8.4 billion by 2024.7
* According to Report Linker, the global voice cloning market is expected to reach $3.8 billion by 2027
* Meticulous Researcher says the speech and voice recognition market will reach $26.8 billion by 2025
* Text to speech technology is a quickly growing piece of this market. As of 2020, the global text to speech
market was valued at $2 billion USD and is expected to grow to $5 billion USD by 2026.10
With the popularization of smart speakers occurring within the general public and the widespread
adoption of virtual assistants within businesses, synthetic voice is clearly heading into mainstream
utility. It will be widely used, consistently iterated, and employed for a plethora of different purposes.

## The Benefits of Synthetic Voice
Synthetic voice can be used for extremely positive reasons. Two examples often cited include the ability
of actor Val Kilmer to “speak” after throat cancer and the firm Sonantic’s work archiving his voice.
Below is a list of some of these positive use cases with inclusion and access for those with disability,
adding additional layers to authentication of sensitive documents, and improving customer service
systems such as IVR ranking as most significant.

Positive use cases are listed as follows:
• Inclusion and access for those with disabilities (i.e., the blind or the functionally illiterate) such
as archiving voices lost such as Val Kilmer
• Transposing existing text based digital content to speech (i.e., news and corporate publications
and communication). (Here, an example of Trinity Audio’s text to audio player at work.)
• Aiding in educational learning and content
• Advanced manufacturing manuals and FAQ
• Chatbots/voicebots
• Multiple voice options on one platform
• Audio books
• Gaming (An example found at the reference.)
• Voice authentications for financial or sensitive materials. US Bank implemented in 2020 voice
assistance as a part of their mobile banking options15
• Licensing and monetization for voice actors.
• Improving IVR and customer service systems (Statista16 reported that organizations that
adopted voice assistance decreased their customer service costs as well as the number of calls
to their call centers by 20%)
• Preserving/archiving indigenous and or ethnic voices
• Podcasting with a more engaging synthetic voice. For example, Rumble Studio’s Audio Leads
podcast demonstrates their asynchronous podcast recording product
• Streamlining the cultivation and creation of content for companies and brands.

## Potential Threats and Harms of Synthetic Voice
There are many widely-known examples of synthetic voice being used for nefarious ends:
• Data breaches and identity theft: an example, the theft of $35 million from a Dubai bank using
AI Voice cloning in 2021.
• The abuse and theft of financial or sensitive materials through false voice authentications such
as the theft of $243,000 by impersonating the CEO of an energy firm in 2019.
• Spreading misleading information through false content; a society-wide worry.
• Falsified attribution and the illegal impersonation of voice actors and celebrities. This is theft of
one’s intellectual property i.e., their voice. An example of this was the improper use of Bev
Standing’s voice on TikTok.
• Social bullying, not dissimilar from a Facebook comment rant, can affect any of us in a very
hostile way. And hitting a record button is just as easy and fast as hitting a post button before
thinking.
• Blurring the line between human talent and digital art. For example, NFT’s that are a recreation
of already existing art. Some artists have argued that their artwork has been tokenized without
their permission.

## The Stakeholders in Synthetic Voice and How Are They Impacted?
From voice actors to advertisers to gamers, there is a wide range of individuals who may be impacted by
the usage of synthetic voice. Here is a working list of potential stakeholders
• Voice actors/agencies/managers/unions (i.e., SAG-AFTRA)
  o  Harm: theft of IP.
  o Benefit: new revenue streams.
• Synthetic voice creators and production companies
  o Harm: Spreading misinformation.

  o Harm: theft of IP.
  o Benefit: New revenue streams.
• Children and parents relative to their toys and manipulatives
  o Harm: Inappropriate representation of voice or inaccurate language/information.
  o Benefit: More ways of learning and playing.
  
## Next Steps: Development of Guidelines and Standards
How do we proceed? Below is a list of five action steps (in order of priority) that should help to begin the
process. These steps will help to protect the use of synthetic voice and best position it to be of benefit to
the population rather than a harm.
1. Education and awareness throughout the voice and synthetic voice industry and beyond. This
would be executed through industry events, press events, and general social and social media
awareness.
2. Creating a means of detecting fakes; a watermarking service or some kind of authenticator that
can be turned on and off. This technology will give consumers the ability to detect fraudulent
usage.
3. Governance and guidelines. Establishing rules and a body for governance (MPAA) to work
toward something like a VAST template in advertising. This will help to assure that the future
developers and synthetic voice users will not have an easy time abusing the technology.
4. Establishment of a registration ledger for those natural human voices used to better track
fraudulent vs. legitimate usages of voice actors IP.
5. A distinction between professional and casual voice actors within the governance and
corresponding guidelines. (With reference to step 3.)

## The Purpose of the Synthetic Voice Study Group
To clarify the legal and ethical position around the issue of Synthetic Voice production and usages as
well as to create and implement actionable steps to detect and protect against fraudulent use. 

## The Role of the Open Voice Network
The Open Voice Network promotes the values of ownership, explicit transparency, and consent. It also
protects the rights of intellectual property and content creation and ownership. The OVON seeks to
make voice technology worthy of user trust through the communal development and adoption of
industry standards and usage guidelines, industry education and advocacy initiatives, and the
development and documentation of voice-centric value propositions.
