# OPEN VOICE NETWORK ANNUAL REPORT 2022 

2022.12.31

## Executive Summary 

In calendar year 2022, the Open Voice Network identified and published a unique approach to the interoperability of conversational assistants, and asserted industry leadership in the realm of ethical AI.  This progress, however, ran into stiff industry headwinds marked publicly in September and October 2022 by program reductions and personnel layoffs at Amazon’s Alexa voice unit.  These headwinds, combined with senior executive changes at Target Corporation, led to the loss in November 2022 of two Platinum sponsors (Deutsche Telekom and founder Target Corporation), and internal leadership conversations as to the future of the Open Voice Network as an independent Directed Fund of the Linux Foundation.

Of note: weeks after significant popular and trade press comment as to the failures of Alexa and of voice assistance in general, the start-up Open AI announced and demonstrated ChatGPT, a generative AI tool that uses natural language and a large language model.  By year-end, it promised a brighter, yet different future for the Open Voice Network, one focused on what might be termed conversational AI. 

## Leading Achievements, Issues 

* The highlight of the year was the publication of six seminal white papers in Q3 and Q4 that asserted the Open Voice Network’s leadership in the realms of interoperability, ethical use, privacy, and security for conversational assistance.  The papers can be found here. The interoperability, ethical use, and privacy-security work was also communicated through public webinars, which attracted audiences across Europe and North America.
* The Open Voice Network finished 2022 with ongoing commitments from four financial sponsors:  Schwarz Group, Microsoft Corporation, Wegmans Food Markets, and Veritone, Inc.   Platinum sponsorship was ended in Q4 2022 by Deutsche Telekom (with the loss of Amazon monies and the closure of the Magenta business unit) and Target Corporation (with a new CIO, and the departure of multiple Open Voice Network-supporting executives.)
* Sponsor revenue was maintained at prior year levels, at $444,583 USD.
* Quarterly active participation flagged, as the struggles of the Alexa and Google Home business units and ecosystems were felt across the OVON’s breadth, especially in the industry communities.
* Technical standards for Interoperability were pursued by three Work Groups (Architecture, Voice Registry, and Privacy & Security) under the direction of the Technical Advisory Committee.
* Ethical use and industry use case research was pursued at the beginning of the year by six Communities (Ethical Use Task Force, Commerce, Health-Wellness-Life Sciences, Media & Entertainment, Education Steering Team, and the Synthetic Voice Study Group).   By year-end, the Commerce, Media & Entertainment, and Education Steering Team communities closed due to clearly signaled lack of commitment.

## Standing Committees of the Open Voice Network 

The founding charter of the Open Voice Network specifies a Steering Committee accountable to sponsors and the Linux Foundation for the governance of the organization, and four standing committees, each to be chaired by a representative of a sponsoring member entity and responsible to the Steering Committee. The four standing committees are Technical Advisory, Outreach, Budget, and Legal.

### Steering Committee 

The Open Voice Network Steering Committee met monthly in 2022, with one exception.  The Steering Committee was chaired by Joel Crabb, Vice President and Chief Architect, Target Corporation, until his departure from Target in October 2022.  The role of Chair was assumed by Mirko Saul, Head of Digitalization and Innovation, Schwarz Digital GmbH & Co., KG.  Other Steering Committee members were Ali Dalloul, Vice President, Strategy and Commercialization, Azure AI Cognitive Services, Microsoft Corporation; Doug Rogers, Chief Security Officer, Wegmans Food Markets; Bernhard Hochstätter, Executive Product Manager and Tribe Lead Voice Platform, Deutsche Telekom; Sean King, VP for Enterprise Commercialization, Veritone; and Christian Wuttke, Manager, Conversational AI, Schwarz Gruppe, and Chair, Open Voice Network Technical Committee.   Also participating through the year were Nathan Southern, Program Manager for the Open Voice Network on behalf of the Linux Foundation; Kristi Dank, Secretary Pro Tempore and Director, Target Corporation (until her retirement in mid-2022); and Jon Stine, Executive Director, Open Voice Network.

### Technical Advisory Committee 

The Open Voice Network Technical Advisory Committee operated with three Work Groups (Voice Registry System, Privacy and Security, and Architecture), each tasked to research the market need and opportunity, envision and propose an approach to standardization or industry-wide guidelines, and recommend next steps.  Christian Wuttke, Schwarz Gruppe, served as Chair.  

### Outreach Committee 

The OVN Outreach Committee was not formally constituted in 2022.   Tasks were outsourced to Thrive Marketing, Evansville, Indiana, and included website, social media, and webinar/podcast production and promotion.  In Q3 and Q4, the Open Voice Network engaged Speak2Web, a Minneapolis-area website and voice development firm, to redesign www.openvoicenetwork.org. 

### Budget Committee 

The OVN Budget Committee was not formally constituted in 2022. Throughout the year, OVON budgets and expenditures were reviewed and approved by the Steering Committee.

### Legal Committee 

The OVN Legal Committee was not formally constituted in 2022.

## Communities of the Open Voice Network 

Following the adoption of the founding charter of the Open Voice Network as of 1 June 2020, a number of "OVN Communities" were formed to further the outreach of the OVN into the voice developer, designer-strategist, testing, and enterprise voice use ecosystems, and to provide members of those ecosystems a voice into the vision, strategy, and detailed execution of the Open Voice Network.
OVN Communities are made up of OVN volunteers, and moderated by one or more volunteers, as elected by the Community.   These Communities were operative as of year-end 2022: 

* Ethical Use Task Force Community, for those concerned with critical voice issues such as privacy and inclusivity
* Health, Wellness, and Life Sciences Community, for providers, payers, clinicians, researchers;
* Synthetic Voice Study Group, for the creators and users of voice talent and synthesized voice.
