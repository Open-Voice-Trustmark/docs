# 2021 Annual Report of the Open Voice Network 

## Introduction 

The Open Voice Network (OVON) is a non-profit industry association dedicated to the development and proposal of technology standards and usage guidelines for the emerging world of voice assistance. It is an open-source community of the Linux Foundation, and is independently funded and governed.

This is the official record of the Open Voice Network for calendar year 2021.

## 2021: Year-End Evaluation

The Open Voice Network (OVON) progressed in 2021 from team formation, process normalization, and task definition to the first deliveries of publicly-reviewed documents, white papers, and technical demonstrations. 
 
Key performance metrics -- sponsor revenues, monthly active participation, industry recognition, media reach, and publications --  all grew from 2020 levels.  However, in all cases, the key performance metrics did not reach desired levels. 

Why?  Three primary reasons:

OVON leadership naivete as to the realities of development and delivery with and through an organization primarily populated by volunteers.  Significant time was invested in shifting responsibilities and on-boarding new leaders; deliverable development schedules were repeatedly extended.

The low priority of voice technology on pandemic-driven enterprise investment lists – a prioritization often driven by a decision-maker perception that voice technology is little more than a consumer smart speaker, a toy for the home rather than a tool for value creation.  

The relatively small size – in staff, sponsors, accomplishments – of the Open Voice Network.   Several prospective sponsors and potential participants asked to delay further conversation until greater sponsorship or significant deliverables were achieved.  This chicken-egg challenge is no doubt faced by every new organization; its impact on 2021 Open Voice Network development was not unexpected, and felt often.

At the same time:

In private development conversations and public presentations, Open Voice Network leaders were buoyed by responses that echoed the inevitability of voice interfaces and enterprise voice assistants, and the importance of the Open Voice Network’s mission. 

Given this response, we believe the core variable before the Open Voice Network is when, not why, what, or how. 

## Performance Metrics and Highlights.
 
In 2021,

* The Open Voice Network finished 2021 with six financial sponsors:  Target Corporation, Schwarz Group, Microsoft Corporation, Wegmans Food Markets, Deutsche Telekom, and Veritone, Inc.   New sponsors in 2021 were Deutsche Telekom (Platinum), and Veritone, Inc. (Supporter).
* Sponsor revenue grew from $330,000 USD to $430,000 USD.  
* Quarterly active participation grew to more than 200 individuals from 13 nations.
* The OVON mailing list grew from 507 unique e-mail addresses at year-end 2020 to 920 unique e-mail addresses. 
* Technical standards and usage guideline development was pursued by three Work Groups (Architecture, Voice Registry, and Privacy & Security) under the direction of the Technical Advisory Committee.
* Ethical use and industry use case research was pursued by six Communities (Ethical Use Task Force,  Commerce, Health-Wellness-Life Sciences, Media & Entertainment, Education Steering Team, and the Synthetic Voice Study Group). 

In addition,

* Open Voice Network leaders provided voice-centric industry and technical information to senior leaders of the European Union, and the OVON was recognized in EU publications.
* An Open Voice Network white paper from the OVON Media & Entertainment Community (“The Future of Media & Entertainment Informed by Voice,” June 2021) was cited and excerpted by Variety, the long-standing entertainment industry publication of record. 
* The OVON Architecture Work Group, tasked with developing the protocols that will enable agent-to-agent interoperability, demonstrated the passing of data between two voice agents of different parentage – a small but critical first step.
* The OVON Privacy & Security Work Group published in March its  1.0  “Privacy Guidelines and Capabilities Unique to Voice,” and took the paper through an extensive public review cycle. 
* The OVON Voice Registry System Work Group in Q3 and Q4 developed and published two proofs of concept for technical review. 
* The Open Voice Network Technical Committee hired its first outside consultant contractor, for research into security issues specific to voice  (and was expected to hire two additional consultant contractors within January 2022). 
* The Open Voice Network adopted a new acronym (OVON) and logo (see above) as it grew in awareness and worked through trademark evaluation.

This work points to a 2022 of impact, growth, and challenge for the Open Voice Network.   In 2022, the OVON is expected to demonstrate agent-to-agent interoperability and propose the first of standard interoperability protocols;  publish enterprise guidelines for privacy and security specific to voice, as well as develop potential industry standards that will advance both; and publish the first drafts of documents that speak to an envisioned Voice Registry System – a DNS for voice.

In addition, the ethical use and industry Communities of the Open Voice Network are expected to publish a guide to the ethical use of voice assistance, and key use cases for voice assistance in the commerce, health/wellness/life sciences, media and entertainment, and K-12 education industries.  Continued research into use cases and standards is also expected on the topic of synthetic voice.

## Standing Committees of the Open Voice Network 

The founding charter of the Open Voice Network specifies a Steering Committee accountable to sponsors and the Linux Foundation for the governance of the organization, and four standing committees, each to be chaired by a representative of a sponsoring member entity and responsible to the Steering Committee. The four standing committees are Technical Advisory, Outreach, Budget, and Legal.

## Steering Committee 

The Open Voice Network Steering Committee met monthly in 2021, with one exception.  The Steering Committee was chaired by Mike McNamara, Executive Vice President, Chief Information and Digital Officer, Target Corporation.  Voting members were Mirko Saul, Head of Digitalization and Innovation, Schwarz Digital GmbH & Co., KG; Ali Dalloul, Vice President, Strategy and Commercialization, Azure AI Cognitive Services, Microsoft Corporation; Joel Crabb, Vice President, Architecture, Target Corporation; Doug Rogers, Chief Security Officer, Wegmans Food Markets; Bernhard Hochstätter, Executive Product Manager and Tribe Lead Voice Platform, Deutsche Telekom; and Christian Wuttke, Manager, Conversational AI, Schwarz Gruppe, and Chair, Open Voice Network Technical Committee.   Also participating through the year were Neal Caidin, Program Manager for the Open Voice Network on behalf of the Linux Foundation; Kristi Dank, Secretary Pro Tempore and Director, Target Corporation; and Jon Stine, Executive Director, Open Voice Network.

## Technical Advisory Committee 

As of January 1, 2021,  the Open Voice Network Technical Advisory Committee had formed and successfully launched three Work Groups (Voice Registry System, Privacy and Security, and Architecture), each tasked to research the market need and opportunity, envision and propose an approach to standardization or industry-wide guidelines, and recommend next steps.  Dan Cundiff, Principal Engineer at Target Corporation, served as Acting Chair.  

In June 2021, Cundiff left Target Corporation, and his role within the Open Voice Network.  In October, 2021, the OVON Steering Committee confirmed Christian Wuttke, Manager of Conversational Solutions at Schwarz IT, a division of Schwarz Group, as the Chair of the Technical Committee, to serve a one-year term (from October 2021 through September 2022.)  In addition, John Trammell, Principal Engineer at Target Corporation, was confirmed as Vice-Chair for a one-year term (October 2021 through September 2022), with expectation that Chair responsibilities would be assumed at the conclusion of the term.

## Outreach Committee 

The OVN Outreach Committee was not formally constituted in 2021.   However, a group of OVN volunteers met periodically through the year to review
* the design and functionality of the OVN website, www.openvoicenetwork.org
* public presentation and speaking opportunities (despite uncertainties wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic).
* OVON public-facing messaging.

## Budget Committee 

The OVN Budget Committee was not formally constituted in 2021. Throughout the year, OVON budgets and expenditures were reviewed and approved by the Steering Committee.

## Legal Committee 

The OVN Legal Committee was not formally constituted in 2020.

## Communities of the Open Voice Network

Following the adoption of the founding charter of the Open Voice Network as of 1 June 2020, a number of "OVN Communities" were formed to further the outreach of the OVN into the voice developer, designer-strategist, testing, and enterprise voice use ecosystems, and to provide members of those ecosystems a voice into the vision, strategy, and detailed execution of the Open Voice Network.

OVN Communities are made up of OVN volunteers, and moderated by one or more volunteers, as elected by the Community.   These Communities were operative in 2021: 

* Designer-Strategist Community, for voice designers and strategists (on hiatus as of mid-year 2021)
* Ethical Use Task Force Community, for those concerned with critical voice issues such as privacy and inclusivity
* Education Steering Team Community, for educators seeking to use voice assistance in the classroom
* Commerce Community, for retailers, consumer products executives, and the marketers and voice developers-designers who seek to create value through voice.
* Media & Entertainment Community, for those in the advertising, and packaged/live entertainment industries;
* Health, Wellness, and Life Sciences Community, for providers, payers, clinicians, researchers;
* Synthetic Voice Study Group, for the creators and users of voice talent and synthesized voice. 

In addition, an industry advisory team was launched in mid-year 2021 to provide OVON leadership with insight as to voice market transitions and critical issues.
