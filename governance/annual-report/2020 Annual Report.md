#Annual Report of the Open Voice Network: 2020#

##Introduction##

The Open Voice Network is a non-profit industry association dedicated to the development and proposal of technology standards and usage guidelines for the emerging world of voice assistance. It is a directed fund of the Linux Foundation, and is independently funded and governed.
This annual report is the official record of the Open Voice Network for calendar year 2020.

##Founding Actions##

Though the concept of a non-profit industry association dedicated to industry standards for voice had been publicly announced in January, 2019, the organization now known as the Open Voice Network began to take shape in April, 2020, with the commitment of founding financial sponsorship by Target Corporation and Schwarz (Gruppe) Digital GmbH and Co., KG.

Receipt of sponsorship funds and the draft of a founding charter in May 2020 led to a first Steering Committee meeting and the formal establishment of the Open Voice Network on 1 June 2020.

Participating in this first meeting were Steering Committee sponsor representatives Joel Crabb, Target Corporation, and Mirko Saul, Schwarz Digital GmbH and Co., KG; OVN secretary pro tempore Kristi Dank, Target Corporation; Linux Foundation Senior Director of Strategic Programs Scott Nicholas. Of the many actions taken in the initial OVN Steering Committee meeting, two are be noteworthy:

1. The founding charter of the Open Voice Network was affirmed, and the OVN was established as a non-profit industry association, independently funded and governed, and operating as a directed fund of the Linux Foundation.

2. Mike McNamara of Target Corporation was elected to serve as the non-voting chair of the Steering Committee. Dan Cundiff of Target Corporation was named as the acting chair of the OVN Technical Committee. Jon Stine was named as the acting, non-compensated acting executive lead of the OVN.
   
In July 2020, Open Voice Network sponsorship commitments were received from Wegmans Food Markets and Microsoft Corporation. Sponsor representatives Richard Vander Horst of Wegmans Food Markets and Ali Dalloul of Microsoft Corporation joined the OVN Steering Committee at its 17 August 2020 meeting. In September 2020, Doug Rogers replaced Richard Vander Horst as the sponsor representative of Wegmans Food Markets; he first participated in the Steering Committee meeting of 13 October 2020.

In the 13 July 2020 Steering Committee meeting, Jon Stine was named Executive Director of the Open Voice Network.

##Standing Committees of the Open Voice Network##

The founding charter of the Open Voice Network specifies four standing committees, each to be chaired by a representative of a sponsoring member entity. The four standing committees are Technical, Outreach, Budget, and Legal.

##Technical Committee##

The first meeting of what became the Technical Committee of the Open Voice Network was held on 6 March 2020. The Open Voice Network Technical Committee was officially formed upon adoption of the OVN Charter on 1 June 2020. As of 31 December 2020, the Technical Committee had formed and successfully launched three Work Groups, each tasked to research the market need and opportunity, envision and propose an approach to standardization or industry-wide guidelines, and recommend next steps. The Work Groups were in these in three broadly-defined areas of potential standards development:
* A destination registry for voice. This was titled the Voice Registry System Work Group
* Voice-specific privacy and security for voice assistance. This was titled the Privacy and Security Work Group.
* The definition – and potential standardization – of the core components of conversational agents. This was titled the Architecture Work Group. In addition, the Technical Committee also researched – and then established – a common vocabulary for the work of the Open Voice Network.
 
##Outreach Committee##

The OVN Outreach Commmittee was not formally constituted in 2020. However, starting in late October 2020, a group of OVN volunteers began meeting on a bi-weekly basis to develop an outreach strategy for the OVN and complete by 31 December 2020 a number of outreach tasks deemed necessary for the success of the OVN. Among the deliverables were
* the redesign and revision of the OVN website, www.openvoicenetwork.org
* the development and management of an official OVN contact list through the cloud-based services of Active Campaign
* the establishment of format, content, and cadence for a monthly OVN newsletter
* the creation of an OVN "Virtual Ambassador" as both an Alexa Skill and Google Home Action
* the organization and execution of a Zoom-based "Open Voice Network" annual meeting on 15 December 2020 to an audience of 86 individuals.
  
##Budget Committee##

The OVN Budget Committee was not formally constituted in 2020. Throughout the year, plans for OVN expenditures were reviewed and approved by the Steering Committee.

##Legal Committee##

The OVN Legal Committee was not formally constituted in 2020.

##Communities of the Open Voice Network##

Following the adoption of the founding charter of the Open Voice Network as of 1 June 2020, a number of "OVN Communities" were formed to further the outreach of the OVN into the voice developer, designer-strategist, testing, and enterprise voice use ecosystems, and to provide members of those ecosystems a voice into the vision, strategy, and detailed execution of the Open Voice Network.

OVN Communities are made up of OVN volunteers, and moderated by one or more volunteers, as elected by the Commununity. These Communities were formed in 2020:
* Developer Community, for voice developers
* Designer-Strategist Community, for voice designers and strategists
* Ethical Use Task Force Community, for those concerned with critical voice issues such as privacy and inclusivity
* Europe Community, for European OVN participants
* Education Community, for educators seeking to use voice assistance in the classroom
* ommerce Community, for retailers, consumer products executives, and the marketers and voice developers-designers who seek to create value through voice.
  
A Code of Conduct for OVN Communities was adopted by the OVN Steering Committee in its meeting of 13 July 2020. This Code of Conduct can be found in the OVN GitHub Repository.
