# OPEN VOICE NETWORK ANNUAL REPORT 2023

2023.11.05

## Executive Summary

In calendar year 2023, the Open Voice Network (OVON) reached new heights of accomplishment, as it defined and demonstrated a universal API for the interoperability of conversational assistants, and launched the “TrustMark Initiative” an effort to translate ethical principles specific to conversational AI into tangible actions, with an online education course and self-assessment tool.

The OVON also, as of 1 November 2023, ceased to exist as an independent Directed Fund of the Linux Foundation, as its two primary projects – Interoperability and TrustMark Initiative – were transferred to the care and leadership of the significantly larger Linux Foundation AI & Data Foundation.

## Governance Decisions

The loss of Platinum sponsors ($100K per year) Deutsche Telekom and Target Corporation in October 2022 led Open Voice Network leadership to late 2022 conversations as to the long-time viability of the organization.  It was noted that, at current funding levels, the Open Voice Network faced a start-up’s dilemma: though it could deliver meaningful results, current funding levels would not allow the OVON – even with its results – to scale and properly influence the industry.

An inability to win new sponsors in the first half of 2023 led the Steering Committee in its June 2023 meeting to direct the OVON’s Executive Director to find a new organizational home for the Interoperability and TrustMark Initiative projects of the OVON.  Four options were identified; the preferred choice was a migration of the projects to LF AI & Data.

Conversations were opened in July 2023 regarding the hosting of Open Voice Network projects by the LF AI & Data Foundation with LF AI & Data Foundation Executive Director Dr. Ibrahim Haddad, Linux Foundation VP Community Operations John Walicki, and VP Project Formation Scott Nicholas.  Of great assistance also was Nathan Southern, Linux Foundation Program Manager for the Open Voice Network.

Following a series of conversations between Haddad and members of the Open Voice Network Steering Committee, general agreement as to the terms of the transfer was reached on 9 October 2023.  On 19 October 2023 the LF AI & Data Foundation Technical Advisory Committee approved the hosting of the OVON Interoperability and TrustMark Initiative projects at incubation status, and on 30 October 2023, the OVON Steering Committee approved the transfer of the Interoperability and TrustMark Initiative projects to the LF AI & Data Foundation, effective 1 November 2023.

With the transfer of the two projects to the LF AI & Data Foundation, the Open Voice Network Steering Committee also approved the dissolution of the Open Voice Network as an independent Directed Fund of the Linux Foundation effective end-of-day Pacific Daylight Time 31 October 2023.

## Development and Achievement

The **Interoperability of Conversational Assistants** project emerged in 2023 from the work of OVON Architecture Work Group.   From January through end-of-month October 2023, the Interoperability project
* Defined and published the initial technical specifications of the “dialog event,” the core element of what is envisioned to be a universal API for the interoperability of conversational assistants.  This universal API has been termed “The Message Envelope.”  
* Demonstrated the viability of the “dialog event” and other initial specifications through internal proofs-of-concept in live webinar presentations
* Launched creation of a developer sandbox, to be completed in Q1 2024
* Launched a demonstration project in partnership with the Estonia Information Systems Authority (RIA), the creators of the Bürokratt system of conversational assistance for the government ministries of the Republic of Estonia.   As of October 2023, the Estonia RIA-Open Voice Network partnership had led to both validation and revision of the proposed Open Voice Network “Message Envelope” specifications.  In 2024, it is expected that the Estonia-OVON partnership project will demonstrate the delegation of dialogs between Estonia RIA Bürokratt conversational assistants, and between Bürokratt assistants and those of independent third parties.

The **TrustMark Initiative project** emerged from the work of the OVON Ethical Use Task Force.  From January through end-of-month October 2023, the TrustMark Initiative project
* Asserted that ethical principles unique to conversational AI could and should be translated into action – and that action would be of four parts:  endorsement, education, intention, and evidence.
* Asked for, and received individual and organizational endorsement of its six ethical principles unique to conversational AI
* Developed and published on the Linux Foundation LF EdX platform an online educational course that introduced and defined the ethical principles unique to conversational AI https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/the-linux-foundation-ethical-principles-for-conversational-ai
* Developed and tested an online organizational self-assessment tool – for use in internal and third-party audits of ethical AI practices – for launch in November, 2023.

## Organizational Finance

* Through its ten months of 2023, the Open Voice Network enjoyed financial and governance support from Schwarz Group, Microsoft Corporation, Wegmans Food Markets, and Veritone, Inc.   
* Sponsor revenue received prior to 2023.10.31 was $180,000 USD.
Also received prior to 2023.10.31 were 
* contributions from the firms Sestek ($10,000 USD) and Kaizen Secure Voiz ($7,500 USD.)
* anonymous contributions of $100,000 USD.

## Standing Committees and Communities

* Technical standards for Interoperability were pursued by three Work Groups (Architecture, Voice Registry, and Privacy & Security) under the direction of the Technical Advisory Committee.
* Ethical use and industry use case research was pursued at the beginning of the year by three communities (Ethical Use Task Force, Health-Wellness-Life Sciences, and the Synthetic Voice Study Group).

## Communities of the Open Voice Network

Following the adoption of the founding charter of the Open Voice Network as of 1 June 2020, several "OVON Communities" were formed to further the outreach of the OVON into the voice developer, designer-strategist, testing, and enterprise voice use ecosystems, and to provide members of those ecosystems a voice into the vision, strategy, and detailed execution of the Open Voice Network.  OVON Communities are made up of OVON volunteers, and moderated by one or more volunteers, as elected by the Community.   These Communities were operative in 2023: 

* Ethical Use Task Force Community, for those concerned with critical voice issues such as privacy and inclusivity
* Health, Wellness, and Life Sciences Community, for providers, payers, clinicians, researchers;
* Synthetic Voice Study Group, for the creators and users of voice talent and synthesized voice.
